Problem Statments - 
What was most popular movie/dish/series/match/story/book/video/stocks of 2022 like all that?
Which Movie has given highest IMDB rating on netflix OTT platform?
Which best comedy movie of 2022?

We can solve above problem with below technologies 
  -  Python(pandas)(20m cvs, 100m) Huge data we need to process in less time
  -  RDBMC (Oracle, MySQL, Postgess) - Work well when data in TB, but what if data is in PB and HB, It will give you RTO(Request Timeout)
  -  NoSQL (It help you to store huge size of data, but we need to process that data(like finding the rating or reviews, popularity), Good storage but not good comput)
  -  Exel (100000) it gives error when xls has 1L rows even for opening

To solve this they come with distributed programming ie distributed processing 
Multiple processing working together for common goal (2500 servers)


All servers are connected each others we call it cluster 
we call that server nodes and they connected high bandwidth network
